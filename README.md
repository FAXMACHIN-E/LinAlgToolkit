# LinAlg Toolkit #

### Purpose ###
The main purpose of this library was for me to practice how to create my own projects that follow industry standards.
That means besides the programming practice I used this to learn Maven, Junit, and proper commenting. 

The end goal is to have most useful linear algebra functions (that I know) implemented and have this be a Maven project so others can easily use it.

### Functionality ###
These are the major linear algebra elements that this library has implemented:

- Matrices and Vectors
- Elementary Row Operations
- Reducing to Reduced Row Echelon Form
- Determinants
- Inverting

More to come as this is a work in progress!
